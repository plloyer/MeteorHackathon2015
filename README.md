## Inspiration
My first motivation was to learn meteor, create a second application. My first application is an attempt to recreate billpin which seems to be going into decay, I've publish this first app at: http://billbuz.com/.

Internet of Things have been a popular topic lately and we are seeing many applications being create to monitor data streams. Since I've always been a fan of home automation and as a side hobby I build my wireless arduino sensors, I wanted to be able to track my home sensors in a convenient way. I have few Arduino with nRF24L01 and sensors which are battery powered around the house.
